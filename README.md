# webpack-screencast
Updated some of these examples: https://github.com/iliakan/webpack-screencast

This screencast http://learn.javascript.ru/screencast/webpack is very useful for learning Webpack.
Unfortunatelly, it was created 3 years ago, and now code examples does not work with current webpack version.
This repository contains some of updated examples, which should work with webpack 4.

Usage: "npm i", then run "npm run dev" from your console.
You need node.js installed first.
